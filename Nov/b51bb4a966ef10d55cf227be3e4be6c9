 City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba will soon know his fate as EFF votes with the ANC in an attempt to oust him on Thursday. The ANC is tabling a vote of no confidence against Mashaba after EFF expressed regrets for backing Mashaba. ANC Johannesburg spokesperson Jolidee Matongo confirmed that the ANC has been in talks with the EFF. “We think they may support us to remove Mashaba but they may not support us to bring the ANC back in power, but it’s a discussion we are prepared to have with the EFF at the right time,” Matongo said. EFF leader Julius Malema publicly expressed his party’s regrets and said that they made a mistake to back Mashaba in the first place. The ANC currently has 119 councillors in the 270-seat council. It said it already had the support of the Patriotic Alliance, with one seat, and the African Independent Congress, with four. However, it will need the EFF’s 30 seats to secure a simple majority to remove Mashaba. It is reported that the Democratic Alliance sent an email to its supporter informing them that “We could lose Jozi”. It is reported that the DA has failed to provide proof of the multibillion-rand corruption it claims to have uncovered.   comments
