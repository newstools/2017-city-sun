The DA is under fire after proof of payment shows that the party received R300 000 from Atul Gupta. It is not clear whether the document is real or it is photoshop. What appears on the receipt are two separate payments that were allegedly received by the DA. In 2013 the then DA leader Helen Zille said that the DA received an electronic transfer of R100 000 from Islandsite Investments, which is also linked to the Gupta family. It later emerged that the total amount received by the DA from Guptas is actually R400 000. Zille explained that she was informed that the other R200 000 donation, received for the party’s election campaign, came from Stefan Nel, a Sahara Computers executive director. The Guptas own Sahara and Atul Gupta is the company’s managing director.   comments
