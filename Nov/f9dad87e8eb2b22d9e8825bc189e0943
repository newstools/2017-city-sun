  Real estate agent Vicki Momberg who was caught on camera ranting at a police officer has been found guilty by the Randburg Magistrates’ Court today. Handing down her ruling, Magistrate Pravina Rugoonandan said the words used by Momberg were of racist nature and her action was intentional. Rugoonandan reminded Momberg that such words are unlawful and she should have not used such language. Here are four charges leveled against Momberg: 1. For calling the 10111 hotline and calling the person who answered the phone a “f*****g k****r”; 2. For calling another call centre agent a “f*****g bitch”. 3. For calling the 10111 call centre agent a “useless k****r”; and 4. For calling Constable David Mkhondo, who assisted her on the scene of her accident a “useless k****r” and “black bastard”. In the video clip that went public, Momberg can be heard complaining about the “calibre of blacks” in Johannesburg. “The calibre of blacks in this town [varies] from the calibre of blacks in Durban. They’re opinionated, they’re arrogant, and they’re just plain and simple useless. “I am happy for a white person to assist me, or a coloured person, or an Indian person. I do not want a black person to assist me,” she shouted. “Let me tell you something. This is the type of police force we have got. We’ve got a low calibre of people working. If I see a black person, I will drive them over. “If I have a gun, I will shoot everyone,” she told the officer before driving off. Earlier this year during her trial, she said that she was not able able to identify the alleged smash-and-grab suspect. “All I would have been able to say was that he was black,” she said.   comments
