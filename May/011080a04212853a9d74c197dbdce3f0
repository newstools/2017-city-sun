The African National Congress has finally broken its silence on Eskom board&#8217;s decision to return Brian Molefe as it CEO. In a statement issued by the party of Tuesday, the ANC speaks strongly about a statement made by Molefe and a letter written by Public Enterprises minister Lynne Brown.The ANC said:&#8220;The African National Congress has noted the representations made by ESKOM in Parliament today in relation to the reinstatement of Mr. Brian Molefe as Chief Executive Officer of the power utility.&#8220;According to the incoherent version tabled today, Mr. Molefe had never resigned from ESKOM but rather was on unpaid leave. This is in direct contradiction to Mr. Molefe&#8217;s own statement when he left the utility, where he said &#8220;I have, in the interests of good corporate governance, decided to leave my employ at Eskom from 1 January 2017. I do so voluntarily&#8230;&#8221; and Minister Brown&#8217;s letter dated 30th November 2016 where she approved the appointment of Mr Koko as Acting Group CEO following &#8220;the resignation of Mr Brian Molefe&#8221;. On the strength of the representations from Minister Brown and Mr Molefe, the ANC acceded to his nomination as Member of Parliament. Not only are these latest developments disingenuous to say the least, they amount to perjury. The African National Congress calls on government and Parliament to act decisively to deal with this irrational and untenable situation,&#8221; read ANC statement. comments
