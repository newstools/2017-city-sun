Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan will appear before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on Tuesday morning to explain Treasury&#8217;s role in Sassa&#8217;s contract with CPS.Scopa want to know if the new contract between Sassa and Cash Paymaster Services is lawful and will not lead to unnecessary losses.Social development Minister Bathabile Dlamini appeared before Scopa last week and she shared more details on the new contract with CPS. She assured South Africans that all grants will be paid as normal by the end of March. President Zuma also weighed in and asked media not to accuse Dlamini because not a single grant has not been paid yet.Zuma was responding to calls from various organizations to have Minister Dlamini sacked, a move that Zuma rejected.Scopa chairperson Themba Godi says he s hoping Gordhan can shed more light on the matter. What is it that National Treasury has done? What is it that they have advised? What is it that they have seen since the Constitutional Court ruling, to find out what their stance is, what their involvement is to the current problem for new contract? The Inkatha Freedom Party s Liezel van der Merwe is also set to ask the National Assembly to back her call for a full investigation into the CPS tender. comments
