Sassa has missed the Constitutional Court deadline to file papers that explain its failure to come up with a plan to take over payment of social grants to millions of beneficiaries in April.Last week the Constitutional Court directed Sassa to explain who was responsible for deciding that Sassa could not immediately take over the payment of grants and pensions after March 2017. The court also wanted to know as to when that person became aware that it was not going to happen.Sassa was given until 16:00pm on Monday to file its court papers but it failed.The contract between Sassa and pensions and social grants service provider Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) comes to an end on March 31, and there have been fears that grants will not be paid from April 1.Civil rights organisation The Black Sash has taken Sassa to court in a bid to force full disclosure of costs and arrangements between the Sassa and CPS for the payment of social grants from next month.Lawyers for Freedom Under Law (FUL), which has asked to be allowed to intervene as co-applicant in the Black Sash s case, and the South African Post Office (SAPO) did file their papers on time on Monday afternoon. comments
