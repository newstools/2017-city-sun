The Constitutional Court has suggested that Sassa must extend grants payment contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS). This will ensure that grants are paid on 1 April 2017.Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng made the suggestion after listening to arguments presented by Black Sash and Freedom Under Law. It is not clear whether the two organisations had wished for banks to take over CPS contract to pay grants. All the terms that apply there, including tariffs, continue to apply. We are extending for this period on the predictable and known terms. said Chief Justice Mogoeng.Blash Sash had earlier suggested that if the contract between Sassa and CPS continues, it must be monitored by an independent body. comments
