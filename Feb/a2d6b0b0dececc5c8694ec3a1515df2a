The call to have SAA suppliers probed is gaining momentum. This comes after it was revealed that SAA spends R10 billion per annum on Jet Fuel of which all suppliers are white companies. It is alleged that the contracts are for 82 years, which has prompted calls for inquiry. It has also been revealed that:Bain &amp; Company was the largest consultancy in SAA receiving a total of R208,9m handshake after selling the Airlines Fleet under the guise of turning the Arline around 15 years ago.Despite SAA having an approved turn around Strategy, currently government through National Treasury appointed Bain Capital, USA based company as a joint venture with South African based Abacus Advisory for a period of three years. This over R12 million contract is purported to be for the development of strategy and corporate structure.Former CEO of SAA Coleman Andrews who received a payment of R232,2million tax free during his two-and-half years at SAA failed to disclose to the Board of SAA during his appointment that he was a founding member of Bain &amp; Company together with his wife.SAA is not flying to Florida in the USA but there are workers (ghost workers) in SAA books and call centre at Florida (USA). This also extend beyond Florida-USA but to various countries.Only 2% of the R24 billion of annual procurement spent is on black suppliers.For over 15yrs there are contracts that have been running on month to month basis and extension of contracts excludes incoming of any new suppliersAll aircrafts are being leased internationally with SAA having to pay exorbitant amountsTender for ticket sales is not being advertised but unilaterally awarded to companies in the main white owned companies.Retired and resigned pilots from SAA are allegedly still receiving SAA benefits even after being employed by other airlines. This is due to an evergreen agreement contract signed in the 90&#8217;s.The ANC Women&#8217;s League alleges that this is done consciously to continue with only white owned suppliers being major beneficiaries of tenders at SAA. The DA is accused of trying to derail the probe by suggesting that only Dudu Myeni must be investigated. The DA is strangely mum about all allegations raised by the Women&#8217;s League. comments
