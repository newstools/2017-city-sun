Joburg mayor Herma Mashaba has threatened to dissolve City Power board if it does not resolve to suspend the utility&#8217;s managing director Sicelo Xulu. The ANC has accused Mashaba of trying to influence tenders at the utility.It has come to our attention that Mashaba is putting pressure on metro boards to fire senior managers because they were employed by the previous administration of the ANC,&#8221; said ANC&#8217;s Jolidee Matongo. Mashaba has pretended to be on a corruption-busting mission, but his extraordinary interest in City Power tenders reveals his true interests,&#8221; he said.Mayor&#8217;s office director of communications, Tony Taverna-Turisan denied these claims. comments
