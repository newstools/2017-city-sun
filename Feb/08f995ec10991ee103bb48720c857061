Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has been asked to investigate the appointment of Moeketsi Mosola as Tshwane City mayor. Cope Youth Movement alleges that mayor Solly Msimanga did not follow proper procedures when he appointed Mosola.Cope YM&#8217;s complaint was submitted to the office of the Public Protector on 3 February 2017. It is not clear why she has not made a statement about the complaint.Cope YM national spokesperson Elias Muller maintained allegations made against Msimanga and his council were very serious and warranted an investigation. I strongly feel that these allegations cannot be ignored as these are allegations of an unlawful decision taken in appointing the city manager. If the allegations levelled against Msimanga and his council are true, their decision to make an illegal and unlawful appointment must be reversed and a suitable person appointed in line with the Municipal System Section 56 Act 32 of 2000. Service delivery will not be compromised in that way, said Muller.It is understood the council ignored two applicants, who met all the requirements needed in terms of the law, but surprisingly they were overlooked while Mosola, who is believed not to have any experience in local government, was appointed, said Muller. That is suspicious, considering that the other applicants are more qualified than Mosola, who the council preferred as the city manager. comments
