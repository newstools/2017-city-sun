Former Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training Mduduzi Manana made his second court appearance in connection with an assault case laid against him. He is accused of assaulting a female in a night club after she verbally abused him and called him gay.During his first court appearance on the 10th of August, Manana was granted R5000 bail after the court was satisfied that he has no previous convictions.During his appearance a group of students gathered outside the court to give him support. It is understood that these came as far as Eastern Cape.&#8220;We simply sympathize with the young leader who we acknowledge has done wrong, we are in no way justifying his actions but see he is remorseful. Unlike many other leaders, he is taking steps to rehabilitate himself, said a member of the group that came to support Manana.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many applauded Manana for tendering his resignation as Deputy Minister of Education. He also released an apology to women and all people of South Africa.&#8220;There is NO excuse in the world to ever justify what I have done and as much as I am completely and utterly shameful of the act,&#8221; read Manana&#8217;s statement.He committed himself to seeking professional help to deal with whatever issues that might have led him to behave in a manner he did.&#8220;I have started seeking professional help so that I emerge as a stronger and better improved person. I have to deal with this problem so that I can continue serving my people as an effective member and leader in our society, said Manana. comments
