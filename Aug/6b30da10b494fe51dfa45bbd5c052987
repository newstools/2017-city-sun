News24 reports have confirmed that the UDM is considering pulling out of DA-UDM coalition nationally as it is unhappy about the conduct of the DA in Nelson Mandela Bay.UDM leader Bantu Holomisa accuses the DA of racism after Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Anthol Trollip fired UDM&#8217;s Mongameli Bobani as MMC for public health earlier this year.News reports revealed that the DA attempted to pass a vote of no confidence on UDM&#8217;s Bobani, a move which has worsened tensions between the two parties. The UDM s participation in the Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay coalition will be reviewed as soon as possible, said UDM leader Bantu Holomisa. If it s a fight they want, they must bring it on. This is what you call dirty tricks similar to the old apartheid tactics, which were used to spite blacks against each other. Shame! said Holomisa. We are still waiting for Trollip s promised investigation findings against Bobani. If this is the DA s style of governance, the UDM might have to review its participation in this coalition arrangement. We cannot tolerate being tossed around by the DA,&#8221; Holomisa said.The DA is also accused of signing an agreement with the councillor from the Patriotic Alliance and promised him the post of deputy mayor if he votes with the DA to pass the vote of no confidence against Bobani. comments
