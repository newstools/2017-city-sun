The High Court has dismissed former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan&#8217;s application seeking relief from intervening in a matter between Okay Investments and four major banks.Judge Aubrey Ledwaba also dismissed Standard Bank&#8217;s application for extended relief. Both Gordhan and Standard Bank were instructed by the court to pay the cost.FNB, Nedbank, Absa, the governor and the registrar of the Reserve Bank and the director of the Financial Intelligence Centre were also pay the cost incurred by Oakbay.It is not clear why Pravin Gordhan wanted the court to declare that he must not intervene on the dispute between Gupta&#8217;s Oakbay and the banks. This came after banks closed Oakbay Investment bank accounts.&#8220;It is not appropriate for a member of the National Executive to draw the judiciary into the exercise of his executive functions as evidenced in this application,&#8221; read the judgment.&#8220;To grant the minister the declaratory relief would allow the judiciary to stray into the exercise of executive functions where the circumstances do not warrant this involvement.&#8221; comments
