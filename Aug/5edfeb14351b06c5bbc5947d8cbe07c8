Julius Malema misled the public when he claimed that he had spoken to 60 ANC MPs who were ready to vote against President Jacob Zuma.&#8220;I personally spoke to more than 60 MPs of the ANC who have committed that if we give them a secret ballot they will deliver,&#8221; Malema told journalists.Malema also claimed that the 60 MPs asked that the vote must be carried out is secret so that they could vote Zuma out. It turns out that all his claims were false.Yesterday the vote of no confidence against President Zuma failed as the opposition failed to convince ANC MPs to vote in favour of the motion of no confidence. This was the 8th motion of no confidence against Zuma to fail.After the opposition approached the Constitutional Court to force the Speaker of Parliament, Baleka Mbete to conduct the vote in secret, failure to remove Zuma is a clear indication to the opposition that they have lost. Conducting the vote in secret should have been a huge victory for the opposition but it was not.With 384 votes cast, 177 voted in favour of the motion, 198 voted no, and nine abstained. The failure of the motion will strengthen Zuma&#8217;s position in the ANC and strengthen the belief that the ANC is decided that Zuma will remain its President until December 2017.The DA is accused of ignoring the fact that the apartheid regime was corrupt and had managed to corrupt the Treasury, the Reserve Bank, the JSE and all state owned enterprises but is gunning for Zuma on basis of corruption claims that have not been tried in a court of law.Claims by the DA that state capture must be blamed on Guptas has angered many people in the society who are very conscious of the fact that state capture started during the corrupt apartheid period. Many have taken to social media to express that the pain and suffering felt by most black South Africans is a direct result of state capture by corrupt apartheid regime capitalists. comments
