Secret records of financial crimes committed during the apartheid government era are to be made public if South African History Archive succeeds in a court battle.These records are kept by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). It has become clear that the records are making their way to the public domain after Zuma axed former finance minister Pravin Gordhan. The matter is scheduled to be heard in court this coming Friday.Linked to these records are prominent business figures who allegedly started multi-national companies using money that earned through corruption.Open Secrets which is an organization which was established by anti-apartheid activists in 1980 is fighting to have the SARB forced to release these secret records. Specifically included in this request was information about fraud through manipulation of the financial rand dual currency, foreign exchange or the forging of Eskom bonds. It is believed that these activities are linked to high profile individuals such as Johann Philip Derk (Jan) Blaauw, Vito Roberto Palazzolo, and Robert Oliver Hill. The South African History Archive (SAHA) released a statement last Friday.SAHA submitted the initial PAIA request in August 2014 in consultation with Open Secrets, a civil society organisation focused on investigating the links between economic crime and human rights abuse. The SARB formally denied SAHA&#8217;s request over 14 months after submission despite the 30 day deadline stipulated by PAIA. The SARB lists, among other reasons, confidentiality and the possible risk to South Africa&#8217;s economic interests as reasons for denying the request.&#8220;Instead of forcing a lengthy legal process, the Governor of the Reserve Bank should consider the proactive disclosure of key archival records. Starting with its own apartheid era archive this would allow the Reserve Bank to emphasise its stated commitment to the values of transparency and integrity,&#8221; read SAHA statement.The actions of the Reserve Bank to withhold information has informed a call by SAHA and other civil society partners for the release of all apartheid-era records held by government. comments
