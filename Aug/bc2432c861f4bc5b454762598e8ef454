The Public Protector made no findings of wrongdoing by Deputy Minister Mduduzi Manana following a complaint that was levelled against him by his staff.Wonga Tabata, who was a chief director on secondment to Manana&#8217;s office approached the office of the Public Protector in 2012 after being fired for non-performance. He claimed that Manana abused his power and demanded that work be done on time.Investigators assigned to the case closed it in 2013 after it emerged that all accusations leveled against Manana were not correct.It is understood that Manana&#8217;s staff who worked with Tabata told investigators that these claims were not true which then led to the closure of the case by the Public Protector. When approached by Sunday Times, Tabata refused to comment.The deputy minister made his first appearance in court on Thursday after he made a public commitment to cooperate. He was was granted R5 000 bail after the court was satisfied that he is not a flight risk.&#8220;I will subject myself fully to the process of the law and give it my full cooperation,&#8221; said Manana in a statement.&#8220;I also commit myself to, when the time is right, further engage with Ms Duma and her family to apologise, take responsibility and address the harm that has occurred,&#8221; he said.&nbsp; comments
