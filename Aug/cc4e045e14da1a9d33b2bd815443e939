Sunday Times newspaper has claimed that Higher Education Deputy Minister Mduduzi Manana was forced by President Zuma to resign.According to Sunday Times report, an unnamed source told the newspaper that the President told Manana to step down or he will have to fire him.These reports contradict the Presidency&#8217;s official statement issued yesterday morning. The statement by the President made it clear that Manana had submitted his letter requesting that he be released from his duties as Deputy Minister.&#8220;President Jacob Zuma has received and accepted the resignation of the Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training, Mr Mduduzi Manana,&#8221; read the statement.Government Communication Communications and Information Systems (GCIS) also released a statement written by Manana where he explained his reasons for resignation. Manana categorically stated in his statement that the his resignation was voluntary.He later published a 3 minutes long video where he unreservedly apologized to all South Africans. In the video Manana confirms that his resignation is voluntary. &#8220;Sunday Times is taking us for a ride. There is a statement issued by the Presidency and another one by Manana approved by GCIS. We also saw a video where he confirms that his resignation is voluntary. How can Sunday Times mislead the public where all information is in front of us,&#8221; said Zamani Ngema who is a social media specialist.&#8220;It is easy to believe Sunday Times report if you do not know how government work. You do not lie about the President just because you have resigned. The fact that GCIS approved his statement is an indication that there are no contradiction between the Presidency statement and that of Mduduzi Manana,&#8221; he said. comments
