The embattled Deputy Minister of Higher Education, Mduduzi Manana was accused of being strict when it comes to work which turned some staff members against him.Manana launched a programme called Careers Sundays where he and his staff visit churches around the country to share information with young people on which career options they can pursue. He also makes bursaries available to at least 20 students per church he visits.During his career Sundays, Manana is always accompanied by staff to provide administrative support and to engage the youth. It is not clear whether the work his staff does on Sundays is considered as overtime.&nbsp;Media reports revealed that one of Manana&#8217;s former staff member, Wonga Tabata reported him to the Public Protector in 2012 after being released from his duties. However the public protector did not make any findings and the case was close in 2013.Following news reports about Tabata&#8217;s abuse claims Manana&#8217;s current staff issued a statement disputing claims by the former staff.&nbsp;&#8220;We are disturbed by the negative sentiments shared by our former colleagues on the person of the Deputy Minister. Whilst we respect their views, at no point, have we encountered a situation where there was abuse in and around our work environment. Our Deputy Minister is a man of integrity and high work ethic; very strict when it comes to work and it is his track record and contribution towards the education of an African child that speaks volumes.&#8221; read the statement. comments
