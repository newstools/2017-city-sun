Oakbay Investments has hit back on Finance Minister&#8217;s court application requesting that the court excuses him from intervening in the matter where all four major banks closed company&#8217;s accounts.Oakbay s acting CEO Ronica Ragavan told the court in an affidavit how Minister Gordhan had planned to clip the wings of the Gupta family investments less than a month after he was appointed by President Zuma. In January 2016, shortly after his assumption of office, the minister called a meeting with about 60 captains of industry and CEOs of large companies in South Africa. The meeting was held on January 29 at Nedbank s office in Sandton, her affidavit read. It would be bizarre if every empowered government official receiving a request for assistance or counsel races to court to seek a declaration that he/she does not have to act on the request, Oakbay told the court. The minister s superfluous application is riddled with factual and legal errors. The minister s reliance on the list of 72 purported suspicious transaction reports is misplaced and the minister s application is supported by a flawed analysis and a faulty factual record, the affidavit read. comments
