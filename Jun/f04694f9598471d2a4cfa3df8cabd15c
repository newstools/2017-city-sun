I have apologised publicly.&#8221;&#8220;What I have not agreed to do is plead guilty to charges of misconduct which I never committed.&#8221; said Zille. Here is Mmusi Maimane&#8217;s full statement:&#8220;We have suspended Helen Zille pending the outcome of her disciplinary hearing.It has become quite evident that Helen and I hold fundamentally different attitudes about the mission the Democratic Alliance needs to accomplish in 2019, and the goals and priorities that flow from this.We live in a fragile democracy which means our public representatives must, at all times, be sensitive to the legitimate anger that people still feel about our past and its legacy.As the Leader of the party, it is up to me to rebuild public trust. In this regard, I asked Ms Zille to tender an unreserved apology to both South Africa and the DA for the damage she has done. Unfortunately, she declined.This has not been an easy decision. But, as the Leader, I must do what is right for the party and South Africa,&#8221; read Maimane&#8217;s statement.Here are some of comments posted by white supporters of the DA: comments
