The Presidency has broken silence on Sunday Times reports suggesting that President Zuma owns a palace in Dubai. News reports revealed that villa L35 in Dubai s Emirates Hills belongs to President Zuma.In 26 May 2016 the City Press reported that the same villa is owned by Gupta family, a story which was titled &#8220;The Guptas R445m Dubai mansion.&#8221;In a statement issue on the 4th of June 2017, the Presidency stated that:The story in the Sunday Times newspaper today, 4 June 2017, that President Jacob Zuma owns a &#8220;palace&#8221; in Dubai is a fabrication. President Zuma does not own any property outside South Africa and has not requested anybody to buy property for him abroad. The President has also not received or seen the reported emails and has no knowledge of them.&#8221;Sunday Times is challenged to prove that the villa belongs to President Zuma and not Gupta family.&nbsp; comments
