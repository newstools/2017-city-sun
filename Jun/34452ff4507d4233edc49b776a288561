Former DA leader and Western Cape Premier Helen Zille has apologized for her racist tweet which caused a stir on social media few weeks ago. The DA held a press briefing today.But minutes after Zille&#8217;s apology, many black people took to social media and expressed how they angered by her pretense.&nbsp;&#8220;I thought they heard Juju&#8217;s warning about Metro munis,they stand to loose Jozi and Tshwane.removing her from DA activities does good only for the DA not the population that was offended by her defence of the murderous apartheid regime,&#8221; wrote Edward&#8220;You are not getting my vote back anyway. Racism goes both ways. Dictators are born, not made,&#8221; wrote Lina.&#8220;Hellen Zille&#8217;s apology is not guinine. Who is fooling who? Mmusi n Zille must know that public are not fools,&#8221; wrote Moosas.&#8220;Now Maimane made a very big mistake. It is now obvious that somebody is using him.And now he is destroying DA. ..iam very angry..mxm,&#8221; wrote Dama.&#8220;So the DA had elected to pamper to the worthless racist losers that scream black inferiority from the roof tops then. Bad move, it&#8217;s going to cost them a lot of votes, perhaps the DA has more similarities with the irrelevant, racist eff that thought,&#8221; wrote Nigel.&#8220;This move is to keep the white vote , but I think maimane lost them all , we are looking out to support another party witch will be their for all , black , white , brown and give equal to all !! No thank u zille can stay right were she is , A % of white people don&#8217;t want to be part of the da any more,&#8221; wrote Sipho.&#8220;You lost my vote but hey &#8230; That&#8217;s just one vote. Your stupidity in understanding and interpreting zille&#8217;s tweet and taking it out of context gives me no confidence in how you would govern if that comes to pass,&#8221; Tshepo. comments
