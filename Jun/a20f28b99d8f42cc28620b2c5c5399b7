Former Eskom chairman of the board has made shocking revelations that former finance minister Pravin Gordhan paid R5 million to Thuli Madonsela when she was still the Public Protector.&#8220;Pravin Gordhan, when he was minister of finance, gave funding to the public protector to hurry up the state capture report.&#8220;It was in the dying days of Thuli Madonsela&#8217;s contract as public protector.&#8220;That is why we were not even given a chance or a hearing. Our documents we submitted were never studied.&#8220;That&#8217;s why the report was hastily produced, without findings, mind you, but only remedial action requiring a judicial commission,&#8221; said Ngubane.Madonsela has refuted these claims but admitted that her office was in need of funding but only received R1.5 million which she says was not enough.During her Parliament address in 2014, Madonsela hinted that her office was &#8220;technically insolvent and it could struggle to continue with its operations in the next three years if its budget is not increased&#8221;.Ngubane refused to provide details to media but said that when time is right all truth will be in the public domain. &#8220;That happened when I was a minister, which I&#8217;m not any more. Speak to Treasury on this.&#8221; said Ngubane.Finance Minister&#8217;s spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete has not yet responded to questions raised by media on these allegations. comments
