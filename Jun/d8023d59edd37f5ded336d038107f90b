A photo showing DA leader Mmusi Maimane giving food parcels to Knysna fire victims is making rounds on social media. Maimane posted it on his Facebook account, a move which backfired at him.Maimane has always accused the ANC of buying votes by distributing food parcels.&#8220;I spent today in Knysna meeting with residents who were affected by the tragic fires.People s lives, like the landscape itself, lie in ashes. I wish to extend my sincere condolences to those who lost their loved ones in this disaster. I also extend my heartfelt gratitude to all who have been involved and reached out to strangers in myriad ways.It is in times like these that we reveal the true depths of our humanity and generosity,&#8221; wrote Maimane. comments
