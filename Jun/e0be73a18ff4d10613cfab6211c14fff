Former leader of the Democratic Alliance has reportedly joined those who are calling for Western Cape Premier Helen Zille to step down. I certainly think she should step down because there s a clear view of her own executive that they have no confidence whether she s handled this matter, that must be the outcome of the weekend decision,&#8221; said Leon.DA leader Mmusi Maimane held a press conference over the weekend and announced that Zille had been suspended pending a disciplinary hearing. But just hours after his announcement, Zille took to social media and called Maimane to order. A different statement was later issue which reversed Maimane&#8217;s decision.It is believed that the party&#8217;s Federal Executive Chair James Selfe consulted with Zille to reverse Maimane&#8217;s decision. Selfe has denied claims that he through Maimane under the bus. No I wasn t, and most certainly not. He, in fact, left slightly earlier. The media conference was in a different venue and I didn t have an opportunity to confer with him about the finer details of this matter,&#8221; said Selfe. comments
