The South Gauteng High Court has ruled in favour of President Zuma, allowing him to appeal previous court decision to hand over hand over records of his cabinet reshuffle.This ruling is a huge set back to the DA which earlier filed an urgent application to force Zuma to reverse his cabinet reshuffle decision. The court disagrees with DA&#8217;s assertion that Zuma&#8217;s decision was irrational and, therefore, unconstitutional.High court judge Bashir Vally said that in circumstances of this nature, he is convinced that President Zuma&#8217;s case should be brought to the attention of a higher court.Analyst believe that Zuma&#8217;s decision to replace former finance minister was aimed at exposing the Treasury to public scrutiny. Just weeks after a new finance minister, Malusi Gigaba took over, a lot of dirt has been reported by media. More pressure is put on Zuma to appoint a judicial commission to probe state capture by white monopoly capital.Today&#8217;s ruling will further affirm President Zuma after the NEC meeting resolved that he will not be removed as the President of the ANC. Some NEC members had tried to cast a vote of no confidence during the NEC meeting but were shamefully defeated.President Zuma is sticking to his guns calling for radical economic transformation, a policy which will grant black people access to land and economic participation. comments
