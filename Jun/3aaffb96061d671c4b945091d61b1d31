Eskom Chairman of the board has resigned from his position with immediate effect, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown announced on Monday. I would like to thank Dr Ngubane for his contribution to turning Eskom around since the load shedding days of 2014/15, and wish him well in the future. To ensure continuity at Eskom, I have decided to appoint Mr Zethembe Khoza as interim chairperson until I am able to take new board appointments to Cabinet for approval, said Lynne Brown.It is believed that Ngubane got fed up by allegations made by media against him. His name has appeared two times in Gupta emails leak but was not given the opportunity to defend himself.In March 1997 Ben Ngubane was appointed Premier of KwaZulu Natal as he served under the Inkatha Freedom Party. Ngubane holds an MB ChB from UKZN Medical School he received in 1971.He served as an ambassador to Japan until year 2008 and was awarded Grand Cordon of the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun.
