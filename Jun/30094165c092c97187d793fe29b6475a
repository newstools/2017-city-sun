The Democratic Appliance has joined other organisations that are opposed to increased participation of black people in the mining sector. This comes after the mining minister Mosebenzi Zwane released a new mining charter which seeks to increase black people&#8217;s participation in mining by 4%.The charter requires at-least 50% black representation on Board Level, 25% of which must be black females; at an executive/top management level and 30% black ownership. &#8220;When the mining industry is destroyed, so too will the livelihoods of the hundreds of thousands of unionised workers who work in the industry. So the charter is unlikely to see the light of day for months or years, but if it did, it would very soon result in marginal mines closing and destroy jobs in a sector which has already lost 60 000 jobs in the past five years,&#8221; read DA statement.&#8220;The charter is Radical Economic Transformation in action,&#8221; said DA leader Mmusi Maimane.It is not clear as to why the DA stands opposed to the revised charter. The previous charter required that at least 26% participation must be from black people. The new charter increased that figure by only 4%. comments
