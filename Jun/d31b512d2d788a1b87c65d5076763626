A letter which was written by Helen Zille to Atul Gupta has come back to haunt the Democratic Alliance as it trends on social media one again. The letter reveals that the DA received R200 000 from Gupta family in their homestead in Saxonwold.A report by Mail &amp; Guardian report revealing that Zille had claimed the money was a donation to the DA.&#8220;I and my colleague Ian Davidson duly went to the Guptas&#8217; home, ate some of the most delicious food I have ever eaten, and received the cheque for R200 000 from the individual,&#8221; said Zille.&#8220;Because we had been guests at the Gupta&#8217;s home, our fundraising department included our standard letter of thanks to the Guptas, even though the donation had not come from them,&#8221; she said.&#8220;The first electronic funds transfer [EFT] was done by Sahara [a company owned by the Gupta family]. The rest of the EFTs were also made through Sahara.&#8221;The letter is circulating on social media after DA leader Mmusi Maimane labelled President Zuma as President Gupta, a move seen by many as hypocritical. Maimane has not commented on the leaked letter where Zille was thanking Guptas for the money received. comments
