Richard Maponya, the 90-year-old owner of Maponya Mall in Soweto has broken his silence on President Zuma&#8217;s decision to dismiss Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.A Sowetan report revealed that Maponya supports Zuma&#8217;s decision to appoint a new finance minister in Gordhan&#8217;s position.&#8220;If you differ with your boss, then there is a problem. There isn&#8217;t anybody in this world who is indispensable and I think [Gordhan] was a little bit on the wrong side.&#8221; Maponya told Sowetan. But he went on to applaud Gordhan for the manner in which he served in his portfolio. &#8220;Zuma may be overreacted and should have pointed [admonished Gordhan] with a big finger and let him go on. But if a man is not done it once and has continuously [been] as defiant as I understand, he was also on the wrong side.&#8221; Maponya said.Maponya reportedly lashed out at deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary- general Gwede Mantashe and party treasurer Zweli Mkhize for questioning President Zuma&#8217;s decision in public.&#8220;The boeres are just as bad as the Guptas.&#8221; concluded Maponya in his interview with Sowetan. comments
