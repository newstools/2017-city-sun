The credit rating agency Moody s was fined for its $864m to settle with US federal and state authorities for its false ratings of risky mortgage securities, a move which led to the 2008 financial crisis.Moody s did not comply its own credit-rating standards and fell short on its pledge of transparency in the run-up to the recession.This was not the first time that a rating agency commit such an act. In 2005 the world s largest ratings firm, Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s was fined $1.375bn for similar act.In 2015 the S&amp;P Global Ratings also paid about R26 billion fines on similar charges of manipulating its rating which had terrible impact on global economy. The repackaging of debt into securities with top ratings from S&amp;P and other rating firms contributed to more than 1.25 trillion in losses and writedowns when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008.S&amp;P Global Ratings on yesterday downgraded South Africa to sub-investment grade, citing the massive Cabinet reshuffle as the reason behind its decision.S&amp;P said the executive changes initiated by President Jacob Zuma have put at risk fiscal and growth outcomes. comments
