Kwazulu Natal ANCYL has come out guns blazing and attacked former finance minister Pravin Gordhan for mobilizing society against cabinet reshuffle.This comes after Gordhan publicly announced that he is not ashamed for mobilizing the society to challenge President Zuma s decision to reshuffle. I m unashamedly encouraging mass mobilisation said Gordhan at the Ahmed Kathrada memorial in Johannesburg.When responding to Gordhan s utterances, the Youth League warned him and committed itself to squeeze him out if he does not back off. This is the ANC Youth League we will squeeze out Pravin Gordhan. He has failed to mobilise for the ANC how he will take on such a powerful organisation? Pravin can t mobilise society. Otherwise the ANC would have been dominating in Chatsworth and Phoenix. said ANCYL.The league went on to allege that Gordhan was planning to start his new political party. Watch this space there s a possibly a new party coming. That s why the NEC must reign in Gordhan, ANCYL. comments
