The ANC has come out in strong defence of President Jacob Zuma and his decision to reshuffle his cabinet, a move which is a slap in the face of the opposition. This comes after it held a Special NWC meeting on Tuesday, 4 April 2017 which followed a closed session of the National Officials held on Monday and Tuesday, 3rd and 4th April respectively.During its press briefing held during lunch time today, all leaders of the ANC spoke in one voice in support of its President. ANC&#8217;s Secretary General Gwede Mantashe explained to journalists that the party condemned some of its leaders who publicly criticized Zuma&#8217;s decision to recall five ministers.When asked if Zuma consulted the party before he reshuffled, Mantashe told the press they were informed as from November of 2016 about the intention to replace Gordhan but they objected to it then. According to Mantashe, the main reason for Gordhan&#8217;s replacement is that his relationship with Zuma was broken and irretrievable. &#8220;The NWC has accepted the irretrievable breakdown of the relationship between the President and a member of his Cabinet as sufficient explanation for the decision taken by the President. The issue of the intelligence report complicated the matter, creating a lot of unhappiness. This was consequently presented as the only reason for his removal which was unfortunate and incorrect.&#8221; read ANC statement.Mantashe stated that the ANC agrees that it is Zuma&#8217;s constitutionally mandated prerogative to appoint ministers. The ANC rallies behind Zuma call for radical economic transformation.&#8220;The ANC remains committed to radical economic transformation through the implementation of our unambiguous fiscal policies which are premised on the need for fiscal consolidation balanced with the imperatives for accelerated and inclusive growth,&#8221; ANC. comments
