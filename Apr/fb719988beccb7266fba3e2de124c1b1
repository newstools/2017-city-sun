The Democratic Alliance hypocrisy has been exposed after the party called for ANC MPs to vote against their party&#8217;s caucus directive on the vote of no confidence against President Zuma.Just five months ago the DA fired five councillors in the City of Cape Town for voting against their party&#8217;s caucus directive. All five councillors were subjected to internal disciplinary process. They were accused of voting against the party&#8217;s preferred candidate for Ward 2 subcouncil chairperson in Kraaifontein.The councillors apparently ignored a party directive to vote for Clive Justus and instead voted for Grant Twigg. There was a directive given for the DA&#8217;s preferred chairperson Clive Justus and then the councillors voted for another councillor, which is essentially against the directive given to them. said DA s Anneke Scheepers.The DA is calling for ANC MPs to vote against the position of the ANC when the vote of no confidence is debate in parliament. comments
