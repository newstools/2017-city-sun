Iam more than confident that the majority of delegates at this ANC 54th National Conference have voted to restore the integrity of our glorius movement . They have also voted to restore the confidence of our people in our ANC .  I am more than confident that these delegates have in their numbers voted for an ANC top six that has the political will to renew , rebuild , unite and save our ANC from patronage , arrogance , factions and corruption .
