A group of 10 young women have surprised former Higher Education Deputy Minister Mduduzi Manana as they organized a luncheon surprise to thank him for the support he gave them. Through his Mduduzi Manana Foundation (MMF) and other stakeholders, Manana previously selected 10 young women to study as pilots, IT specialists, maritime engineers and naval architects. “I want to thank you all for working hard to achieve your dreams. This foundation remains committed to ensuring that women are empowered so that they can contribute meaningfully to our economy,” said Manana.    comments
